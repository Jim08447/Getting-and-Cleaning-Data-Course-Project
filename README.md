Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository is a submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It has the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

    CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
    run_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
        Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
        Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
        Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
        Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
        From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

    FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
    

The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and analysis following  the steps required as described in the course project's definition

# Setting working Directory for the analysis and loading relevant packages
- setwd("G:/Data Science with R-Coursera/Getting and Cleaning Data")
- library(dplyr)
- library(tidyr)
- library(data.table)

# 1.)  Downloading and loading the required data in R
- dataurl = "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip "
- download.file(dataurl, "alldata.zip", mode = "wb")
- unzip(zipfile = "alldata.zip")
Viewing the files
files <- list.files("UCI HAR Dataset", recursive = TRUE)
files
The files we're interested in are

- test/subject_test.txt
- test/X_test.txt
- test/y_test.txt
- train/subject_train.txt
- train/X_train.txt
- train/y_train.txt
- activity_labels.txt
- features.txt

# 2.) We now read in all the various data sets
Let's read in the Activity and Feature labels
activity_label <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt")
features_label <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt")

Let's read in the test data set
subject.test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt", header = FALSE)
x.test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt", header = FALSE)
y.test <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt", header = FALSE)

Let's read in the train data set
subject.train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt", header = FALSE)
x.train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt", header = FALSE)
y.train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt", header = FALSE)


# 3.) Let's combine the individual data sets
datsubject <- rbind(subject.train, subject.test)
datactivity <- rbind(y.train, y.test)
datfeatures <- rbind(x.train, x.test)

Let's name the columns fo the data set
names(datsubject) <- c("subject")
names(datsubject) <- c("activity")
names(datfeatures)<- features_label$V2

Now we combine all data set to get full data set
combdata <- cbind(datfeatures, datsubject, datactivity)


# 4.) Now we extract the columns with Mean and Std values
subfeatures <- features_label$V2[grep("mean\\(\\)|std\\(\\)", features_label$V2)]
datanames <- c(as.character(subfeatures), "subject", "activity")
finaldata <- subset(combdata, select = subfeatures)
str(finaldata)

# 5.) Using the activity labels, we'll give descriptive labels the activities variable
The variables we'll be labeling are
prefix tBody is replaced by TimeBody
Acc is replaced by Accelerometer
Gyro is replaced by Gyroscope
prefix fBody is replaced by FrequencyBody
Mag is replaced by Magnitude
BodyBody is replaced by Body
-mean is replaced by Mean
-std is replaced by Std

names(finaldata) <- gsub("-mean", "Mean", names(finaldata), ignore.case = TRUE)
names(finaldata) <- gsub("-std", "Std", names(finaldata), ignore.case = TRUE)
names(finaldata) <- gsub("tBody", "TimeBody", names(finaldata))
names(finaldata) <- gsub("tGravity", "TimeGrgavity", names(finaldata))
names(finaldata) <- gsub("Acc", "Accelerometer", names(finaldata))
names(finaldata) <- gsub("Gyro", "Gyroscope", names(finaldata))
names(finaldata) <- gsub("fBody", "FrequencyBody", names(finaldata))
names(finaldata) <- gsub("Mag", "Magnitude", names(finaldata))
names(finaldata) <- gsub("BodyBody", "Body", names(finaldata))

# We view the final data output
str(finaldata)

# Let's export the file to a tidy new data set
write.table(finaldata, file = "FinalData.txt",row.name=FALSE)
